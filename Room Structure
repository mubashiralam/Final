//UPDATED 4/26

int item=0; // placed outside of the function, set the item to 0 first and then in the function, you change it to 1

void roomName()
{
	char move;
	int cond2=0; // if you want something to only happen the first time you enter the room, you can set this to 0
			//	and then change it to 1 after the action happens, like on line 12
	string pickup; //variable to accept the item name
	cout << " \n";
	cin >> move;
	
	if (cond2 == 0) //taken from abandoned room, after it runs the first time, it doesn't run again because of cond2
	{
		cout << "You wake up on a hard, cold floor. \n";
		cout << "As you stand up, you see a door in front of you.\n";
		cond2 = 1;
	}
	
	do	{
	cout << "What do you want to do?\n";
	cin >> move;
	switch (move)
	{
	case 'L':
	case 'l':
		cout << " \n";
		break;
	case 'N':
	case 'n':
		cout << "Goes North \n";
		northRoom();
		break;
	case 'S':
	case 's':
		cout << "South \n";
		southRoom();
		break;
	case 'W':
	case 'w':
		cout << "West \n";
		westRoom();
		break;
	case 'e':
	case 'e':
		cout << " \n";
		eastRoom();
		break;
	case 'G':
	case 'g':
		cout << "What would you like to pick up? \n";
			cin.ignore(); //ignores other things that were typed before here
			getline(cin, pickup); //so this only accepts stuff after the line
			if (pickup == "Item" || pickup == "item") //two spellings in case the user doesn't want to use capital letters
			{
				item = 1;
				cout << "You've picked up the item. It has been added to your inventory. \n";
			}
			else
				cout << "That's not here. \n";
	case 'M':
	case 'm':
		main();
	case 'Q':
	case 'q':
		return;
	default :
		cout << "Did not recognize that command. Please try something. \n";
  	}
	
	}
}

So in case L you could look around and maybe find a sword or a dog or something. 
If you want to pick up an item, use the case G. I left the item there as an example
Look at the abandonedRoom as an example.
